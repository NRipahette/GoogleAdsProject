So this project is pretty much the same vesion than the one on the play store, except for the play services that don't work here. 
I couldn't manage to test the Play services again or publish it to the play store so you should be able to test the Play services on the published version.

My code is in the "Game" folder the three scripts here and in the folder "MyAds", the three scripts aswell

This version only have the buttons widened and added the code for the listed achievement to be unlockable but
since I cannot connect to the Play services I still can't unlock it but the code is right !!! (Game.cs for the call and PlayGamesController.cs for the method)
